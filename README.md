# Quantum Mechanics I 

## Yachay Tech University - 2024

## About this repository:
This is a collection of lecture notes and programming exercises carried out as part of the Quantum Mechanics I course at Yachay Tech University.

## Lecturer:
Wladimir E. Banda Barragán

## Course description:
This course provides an introduction to the formal mathematical treatment of Quantum Mechanics. The course introduces the Schrodinger Equation and its solutions for different potentials, emphasising on its statistical interpretation and its importance for the description of experiments at quantum scales. Topics range from wave functions, the time-independent Schrodinger equation, through Hilbert spaces and the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, to the description of the hydrogen atom and two-particle systems. The course includes examples of different applications of quantum mechanics, including writing Hamiltonians for different physical systems and extracting information about them.

## Course objectives:
- Understand the fundamental ideas and experiments that led to the formulation of quantum mechanics.

- Learn the mathematical skills and formalism needed to solve Schrödinger’s equation and interpret its solutions.

- Study the Hamiltonians of quantum systems in 1D and 3D for different potentials and coordinates, and provide a detailed quantum description of the hydrogen atom.

- Use quantum mechanics to analyse real microscopic phenomena and interpret experimental data.

## Evaluation:

- Formative evaluation (Homework): 20%

- Laboratory (Quizzes): 20%

- Midterm Exam: 30%

- Final Exam: 30%

Both the midterm and final exams have two components, one is carried out in class, one is carried out at home.

## Very important policies:

There will be neither make-up assignments nor make-up exams. Please do your best in every assignment.

Late assignments without appropriate justification will receive a penalisation according to the following criteria:

- 0-1 day late: -25%

- 1-2 days late: -50%

- 2-3 days late: -75%

- +3 days late: no marks

Late assignments accompanied by appropriate justification (e.g. a medical certificate, etc.) will receive no penalisation.


## Calendar:

The assignment deadlines and exam dates will be discussed and agreed upon in class. Once fixed, all deadlines are hard deadlines.


## Weekly tutoring schedule:

If you have questions on the material, you can find me in the office:

- On Tuesdays: 15h00 – 16h00  

- On Wednesdays: 09h00 - 10h00


## On academic integrity:

- Students are responsible for ensuring the academic integrity of their submitted assignments and exams.

- Cheating in exams, plagiarising, and copying code or solutions from the Internet, from AI platforms (like chatGPT), from other students, or from previous years' solutions are all breaches of academic integrity.

- Academic misconduct will be penalised according to the University’s regulations. Any assignments that infringe academic integrity (even partially) will receive zero marks.
